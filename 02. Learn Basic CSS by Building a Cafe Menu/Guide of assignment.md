# Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu
### Steps that are included to build a Cafe Menu, we learn all basics of CSS by completing this assignment.

## **Step 1**
As you learned in the last few steps of the Cat Photo App, there is a basic structure needed to start building your web page.

Add the `<!DOCTYPE html>` tag, and an `html` element with a `lang` attribute of `en`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  </html>
```

## **Step 2**
Add a `head` element within the `html` element, so you can add a `title` element. The `title` element's text should be `Cafe Menu`.

```html
<head>
  <title>Cafe Menu</title>
</head>
```

## **Step 3**
The `title` is one of several elements that provide extra information not visible on the web page, but it is useful for search engines or how the page gets displayed.

Inside the `head` element, nest a `meta` element with an attribute named `charset` set to the value `utf-8` to tell the browser how to encode characters for the page. Note that `meta` elements are self-closing.

```html
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Cafe Menu</title>
</head>
```

## **Step 4**
To prepare to create some actual content, add a `body` element below the `head` element.

```html
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Cafe Menu</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>  
```

## **Step 5**
It's time to add some menu content. Add a `main` element within the existing `body` element. It will eventually contain pricing information about coffee and desserts offered by the cafe.

```html
<body>
    <main>

    </main>
</body>
```

## **Step 6**
The name of the cafe is `CAMPER CAFE`. Add an `h1` element within your `main` element. Give it the name of the cafe in capitalized letters to make it stand out.

```html
<main>
    <h1>CAMPER CAFE</h1>
</main>
```

## **Step 7**
To let visitors know the cafe was founded in 2020, add a `p` element below the `h1` element with the text `Est. 2020`.

```html
<h1>CAMPER CAFE</h1>
<p>Est. 2020</p>
```

## **Step 8**
There will be two sections on the menu, one for coffees and one for desserts. Add a `section` element within the `main` element so you have a place to put all the coffees available.

```html
    <main>
      <h1>CAMPER CAFE</h1>
      <p>Est. 2020</p>
      <section>
      
      </section>
    </main>
```

## **Step 9**
Create an `h2` element in the `section` element and give it the text `Coffee`.

```html
      <section>
        <h2>Coffee</h2>
      </section>
```

## **Step 10**
Up until now, you have been limited regarding the presentation and appearance of the content you create. To start taking control, add a `style` element within the `head` element.

```html
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Cafe Menu</title>
    <style>

    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>CAMPER CAFE</h1>
      <p>Est. 2020</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Coffee</h2>
      </section>
    </main>
  </body>
```

## **Step 11**
You can add style to an element by specifying it in the `style` element and setting a property for it like this:
```css
element {
 property: value;
}
```
Center your `h1` element by setting its `text-align` property to the value `center`.

```html
    <style>
      h1 {  
          text-align: center;
          }
    </style>
```   

## **Step 12**
In the previous step, you used a type selector to style the `h1` element. Center the `h2` and `p` elements by adding a new type selector for each one to the existing `style` element.

```html
    <style>
      h1 {
        text-align: center;
      }
       h2 {
        text-align: center;
      }
       p {
        text-align: center;
      }
    </style>
```

## **Step 13**
You now have three type selectors with the exact same styling. You can add the same group of styles to many elements by creating a list of selectors. Each selector is separated with commas like this:

```css
selector1, selector2 {
  property: value;
}
```
Delete the three existing type selectors and replace them with one selector list that centers the text for the `h1`, `h2`, and `p` elements.

```html
    <style>
      h1,h2,p {
        text-align: center;
      }
    </style>
```

## **Step 14**
You have styled three elements by writing CSS inside the `style` tags. This works, but since there will be many more styles, it's best to put all the styles in a separate file and link to it.

We have created a separate `styles.css` file for you and switched the editor view to that file. You can change between files with the tabs at the top of the editor.

Start by rewriting the styles you have created into the `styles.css` file. Make sure to exclude the opening and closing `style` tags.

```css
h1,h2,p{
  text-align: center;
}
```

## **Step 15**
Now that you have the CSS in the `styles.css` file, go ahead and remove the `style` element and all its content. Once it is removed, the text that was centered will shift back to the left.

```html
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Cafe Menu</title>
  </head>
```

## **Step 16**
Now you need to link the `styles.css` file so the styles will be applied again. Nest a self-closing `link` element in the head element. Give it a `rel` attribute value `stylesheet` and an `href` attribute value of `styles.css`.

```html
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Cafe Menu</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </head>
```

## **Step 17**
For the styling of the page to look similar on mobile as it does on a desktop or laptop, you need to add a `meta` element with a special `content` attribute.

Add the following within the head element:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

```html
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Cafe Menu</title>
    <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
  </head>
```

## **Step 18**
The text is centered again so the link to the CSS file is working. Add another style to the file that changes the `background-color` property to `brown` for the `body` element.

```css
h1, h2, p {
  text-align: center;
}
body{
  background-color:brown;
}
```

## **Step 19**
That brown background makes it hard to read the text. Change the `body` element's background color to be `burlywood` so it has some color but you are still be able to read the text.

```css
body {
  background-color: burlywood;
}
```

## **Step 20**
The `div` element is used mainly for design layout purposes unlike the other content elements you have used so far. Add a `div` element inside the `body` element and then move all the other elements inside the new `div`.

```html
  <body>
    <div>
    <main>
      <h1>CAMPER CAFE</h1>
      <p>Est. 2020</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Coffee</h2>
      </section>
    </main>
    </div>
  </body>
```

## **Step 21**
The goal now is to make the `div` not take up the entire width of the page. The CSS `width` property is perfect for this. Create a new type selector in the style sheet that gives your `div` element a width of `300px`.

```css
body {
  background-color: burlywood;
}

h1, h2, p {
  text-align: center;
}
div{
  width: 300px;
}
```

## **Step 22**
Comments in CSS look like this:
```css
/* comment here */
```
In your style sheet, comment out the line containing the `background-color` property and value, so you can see the effect of only styling `div` element. This will make the background white again.

```css
  /* background-color: burlywood;*/
```

## **Step 23**
Now use the existing `div` selector to set the background color of the `div` element to be `burlywood`.

```css
div {
  width: 300px;
  background-color: burlywood;
}
```

## **Step 24**
Now it's easy to see that the text is centered inside the `div` element. Currently, the width of the `div` element is specified in pixels (`px`). Change the `width` property's value to be 80%, to make it `80%` the width of its parent element (`body`).

```css
div {
  width: 80%;
  background-color: burlywood;
}
```

## **Step 25**
Next, you want to center the `div` horizontally. You can do this by setting its `margin-left` and `margin-right` properties to `auto`. Think of the margin as invisible space around an element. Using these two margin properties, center the `div` element within the `body` element.

```css
div {
  width: 80%;
  background-color: burlywood;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
```

## **Step 26**
So far you have been using type selectors to style elements. A class selector is defined by a name with a dot directly in front of it, like this:
```css
.class-name {
  styles
}
```
Change the existing `div` selector into a class selector by replacing `div` with a class named `menu`.

```css
.menu {
  width: 80%;
  background-color: burlywood;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
```

## **Step 27**
To apply the class's styling to the `div` element, add a `class` attribute to the `div` element's opening tag and set its value to `menu`.

```html
<div  class="menu">
```

## **Step 28**
Since the cafe's main product for sale is coffee, you could use an image of coffee beans for the background of the page.

Delete the comment and its contents inside the `body` type selector. Now add a `background-image` property and set its value to `url(https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-cafe/beans.jpg)`.

```css
body {
background-image:url(https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-cafe/beans.jpg);
}
```

## **Step 29**
Itâ€™s looking good. Time to start adding some menu items. Add an empty `article` element under the `Coffee` heading. It will contain a flavor and price of each coffee you currently offer.

```html
<h2>Coffee</h2>
  <article>
          
  </article>
```

## **Step 30**
`article` elements commonly contain multiple elements that have related information. In this case, it will contain a coffee flavor and a price for that flavor. Nest two `p` elements inside your `article` element. The first one's text should be `French Vanilla`, and the second's text `3.00`.

```html
  <article>
    <p>French Vanilla</p>
    <p>3.00</p>
  </article>
```
